# Scheme-Functions
A simple program for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and derivation numbers in arrays based on position

# Summary
The program will take two sets of arrays and perform the respective operation on one set of arrays with the other set of arrays. The operations include:

- Adding
- Subtracting
- Multiplying
- Derivation

## Example

You have two sets of arrays, ((1) (2) (3)) and ((4) (5) (6)). If you perform the adding function on these two sets, it will add the numbers within the arrays. 

```
//To perform adding
(poly_add '((1) (2) (3)) '((4) (5) (6)))
```

It will add together (1) and (4). Then (2) and (5). Finally, (3) and (6). The output would look something like 

```
((5) (7) (9))
```

# Notes
The other functions perform in the exact same manner. You can also add more than one number into the individual arrays for more complex operations.
